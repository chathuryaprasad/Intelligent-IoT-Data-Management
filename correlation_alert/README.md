# Intelligent IoT Data Management – Correlation Alert API

## Overview

This module is part of the Intelligent IoT Data Management capstone project.  
The purpose of this service is to detect significant correlation changes between IoT sensor streams over time using rolling window analysis.

The system accepts time-series sensor data through a REST API, preprocesses the dataset, performs rolling-window correlation analysis, detects significant correlation changes, generates alerts, and returns the results in JSON format.

---

# System Workflow

The API receives a dataset from the client application as a CSV file upload.  
The uploaded dataset is converted into a Pandas DataFrame and passed into the preprocessing pipeline.

After preprocessing and validation, the dataset is divided into rolling windows.  
Correlation values are then calculated between selected sensor streams for each window.

The system compares correlation values between consecutive windows to identify significant behavioural changes.  
If the correlation change exceeds the configured threshold, an alert is generated and returned through the API response.

# Features Implemented

## REST API Service

A Flask API service was implemented to expose the correlation alert pipeline through HTTP endpoints.

### Implemented Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/service-status` | GET | Checks whether the API service is running |
| `/detect-correlation-alert` | POST | Runs the full correlation alert pipeline |

---

# API Status Endpoint

## Endpoint

```http
GET /service-status
```

## Purpose

Used to verify that the API server is active and running successfully.

## Example Response

```json
{
  "status": "running",
  "message": "Correlation Alert Service is running.",
  "service": "correlation-alert-api"
}
```

---

# Correlation Alert Endpoint

## Endpoint

```http
POST /detect-correlation-alert
```

## Purpose

Runs the full correlation alert detection pipeline on uploaded sensor data.

---

# Input Method

The API currently accepts sensor datasets through CSV file upload using multipart/form-data.

---

# CSV Upload Implementation

The API accepts a CSV file uploaded using `multipart/form-data`.

The uploaded CSV file is:

1. Read using Pandas
2. Converted into a DataFrame
3. Cleaned and validated
4. Sent into the correlation pipeline

---

# Expected CSV Format

```csv
time,s1,s2,s3
2026-01-01 00:00:00,10,20,30
2026-01-01 00:01:00,11,19,31
2026-01-01 00:02:00,12,18,32
```

# Pipeline Architecture

The system pipeline is divided into several stages.

---

# Stage 1 – Data Loading

The uploaded CSV file is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

### Implemented Operations

- Read CSV file
- Strip column spaces
- Validate dataset structure

---

# Stage 2 – Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing stage cleans and validates the dataset before analysis.

## Operations Performed

### Timestamp Sorting

The dataset is sorted using the timestamp column.

```python
sort_values(by=timestamp_col)
```

---

### Numeric Conversion

Sensor columns are converted into numeric format.

```python
pd.to_numeric()
```

---

### Missing Value Handling

Missing values are detected and handled.

### Logs Generated

```text
[MISSING] Missing values before: X
[MISSING] Missing values after: Y
```

---

### Outlier Detection

Outliers are identified and replaced.

### Logs Generated

```text
[OUTLIERS] Replaced X outlier values
```

---

### Final Validation

The processed dataset is validated before moving into rolling-window analysis.

### Logs Generated

```text
[VALIDATE] Dataset is sorted, clean, and ready for correlation analysis
```

---

# Stage 3 – Rolling Window Generation

The cleaned dataset is divided into rolling windows.

## Purpose

This allows the system to analyse how correlations change over time instead of calculating a single correlation value for the entire dataset.

---

# Rolling Window Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `window_size` | Number of rows per window |
| `step_size` | Window movement interval |

---

# Example

```text
Window 1 uses rows 0–19
Window 2 uses rows 10–29
Window 3 uses rows 20–39
```

---

# Stage 4 – Correlation Analysis

Correlation values are calculated for each rolling window.

## Implemented Functionality

- Pairwise stream correlation
- Pearson correlation
- Spearman correlation

---

# Example Correlation Output

```json
{
  "window_index": 1,
  "stream_1": "s1",
  "stream_2": "s2",
  "correlation": 0.94
}
```

---

# Stage 5 – Correlation Change Detection

The system compares correlation values between consecutive windows.

## Purpose

This stage detects significant changes in relationships between sensor streams.

---

# Delta Correlation Formula

```text
Delta = Current Correlation - Previous Correlation
```

---

# Example

| Previous | Current | Delta |
|---|---|---|
| 0.92 | 0.31 | -0.61 |

A large delta indicates a major behavioural change between sensors.

---

# Stage 6 – Alert Generation

Alerts are generated when correlation changes exceed predefined thresholds.

---

# Alert Severity Levels

| Severity | Description |
|---|---|
| LOW | Small correlation change |
| MEDIUM | Moderate correlation change |
| HIGH | Significant correlation change |

---

# Example Alert

```json
{
  "alert_level": "HIGH",
  "stream_1": "s1",
  "stream_2": "s2",
  "previous_corr": 0.91,
  "current_corr": 0.24,
  "delta": -0.67,
  "window_index": 5,
  "reason": "Significant correlation drop detected."
}
```

---

# API Response Structure

The API response includes summary statistics, detected alerts, correlation change comparisons, and rolling-window correlation values.

## Example Response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "summary": {
    "processed_rows": 1008,
    "windows": 99,
    "correlation_results": 297,
    "changes": 198,
    "alerts": 12
  },
  "alerts": [],
  "changes": [],
  "correlations": [

      "window_index": 1,
      "stream_1": "s1",
      "stream_2": "s2",
      "correlation": 0.94
    }
  ]
